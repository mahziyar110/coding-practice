/*
Given two integers a and b, your task is to calculate :-
a+b
a-b
a*b
a/b

Input
User Task:
Since this will be a functional problem, you don't have to take input. You just have to complete the function
Operators() that takes the integer a and b as parameter.

Constraints:
1 <= b <= a <= 1000

Note: It is guaranteed that a will be divisible by b.

Output
Print the mentioned operations each in a new line.
 */
