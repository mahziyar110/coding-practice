/*
Given a number N, find the sum of all the digits of the number

Note: Use a recursive method to solve this problem.

Input
User Task:
Since this will be a functional problem, you don't have to take input. You just have to complete the function Sum() that takes the integer N as a parameter.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
0 ≤ N ≤ 1000000000

Output
Return sum of digits.
